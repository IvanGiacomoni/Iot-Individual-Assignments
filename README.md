# Gas-Leaks-And-Fires-Notifier

## Scenario
The problem I took into consideration is that of **gas leaks** and **fires** that usually occur in home environments. This problem is very huge, because of the serious injuries and deaths it causes, especially from the fires that are generated after the explosion. Iot is very helpful when we can prevent these terrible situations, for example by using a notification system: the main **goal** of Gas-Leaks-And-Fires-Notifier is that of **preventing the outbreak of fires** by a constant monitoring of the home environment, in particular those points of the house where it is more probable for a gas leak to occur, such as the kitchen.
