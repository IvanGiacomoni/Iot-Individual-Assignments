# Gas-Leaks-And-Fires-Notifier

## Scenario
The problem I took into consideration is that of gas leaks and fires that usually occur in home environments. This problem is a huge problem, because of the serious injuries and deaths it causes, especially from the fires that are generated after the explosion. Iot is very helpful when we can prevent these terrible situations, for example by using a notification system: the main goal of Gas-Leaks-And-Fires-Notifier is that of preventing the outbreak of fires by a constant monitoring of the home environment, in particular those points of the house where it is more probable for a gas leak to occur, such as the kitchen.

## Sensors
The environment will be monitored with the help of two sensors, which will help us to retrieve the data that are useful to our analysis:

- the DHT-22 sensor for retrieving information about the environment temperature
- the MQ-2 sensor for retrieving information about the amount of gas or smoke that we have in the environment

For acting into the environment I used two different types of actuators:

- blink leds, in order to have a visual notification if there is an high probability of an imminent gas leak
- buzzers, in order to have a sound notification if there is an hign probability of an imminent gas leak

The sampling of data from both sensors will be periodic, because if we just think to a real situation where, for example, we are cooking something in the kitchen, but we are not watching what is happening because in the meanwhile we are watching TV, we can't know if we are safe or if we are in danger, and given that every second is important in order to avoid accidents, the sampling must be periodic.  

## Actuators
Speaking about the actuators, their purposes are strictly connected to data retrieved from both sensors: in particular, I used three leds and one buzzer for acting with respect to temperature data, and two leds and one buzzer for acting with respect to gas and smoke data.

Temperature actuators:

- green led, used to notify people that actual values of temperature measured by the DHT-22 sensor are not dangerous
- yellow led, used to notify people that actual values of temperature measured by the DHT-22 sensor are above average, so there is no real danger, but we have to pay attention to what we are actually doing
- red led, used to notify people, together with the buzzer, that actual values of temperature measured by the DHT-22 sensor are above or a lot above average
- buzzer, used to notify people, together with the red led, that actual values of temperature measured by the DHT-22 sensor are above or a lot above average

Gas and smoke actuators:

- white led, used to notify people that actual amounts of gas or smoke measured by the MQ-2 sensor are not dangerous
- blue led, used to notify people, together with the buzzer, that actual amounts of gas or smoke measured by the MQ-2 sensor are above or a lot above average
- buzzer, used to notify people, together with the blue led, that actual amounts of gas or smoke measured by the MQ-2 sensor are above or a lot above average

Also, I want to specify the real utilities provided by both leds and buzzers. Leds are very useful in a lot of situations, for example that of a person that is listening to the music on his phone at a very high volume, and cannot hear the buzzer sound, while buzzers are useful in different types of situations, for example situations where people are very distracted and do not notice that the red led is flashing, or when they are sleeping, or also when they are out of home and neighbors could hear the buzzer noising.

## Data collected
For the DHT-22 sensor we have this features:

- Dimensions: 28mm X 12mm X 10mm
- Unit of measurement: Celsius degrees
- Temperature measurement range: [-40 , 80] Â° C
- Periodicity of the measurements: 10 seconds

The DHT22 is a digital sensor that converts the analog signals to digital so that it can be easily read by the MCU. It is made up of three pins:

- VCC pin for the power supply voltage of 5V
- out pin for the connection to a digital pin where the signal is taken
- GND pin for the connection to ground

Below we can see an image of the DHT-22 sensor:

For the MQ-2 sensor we have this features:

- Unit of measurement: parts per million
- Temperature measurement range: [100, 10000] ppm 
- Periodicity of the measurements: 2 seconds

The MQ-2 sensor is an analog sensor, and it is made up of four pins:

- VCC pin for the power supply voltage of 5V
- AOUT pin for the analog exit
- DOUT pin for the digital exit (we will not use it)
- GND pin for the connection to ground

Below we can see an image of the MQ-2 sensor:

I want to notice that gas and smoke will be sampled more often than temperature data, because even if both are important in our scenario, it is clear that the greater danger will come from smoke and gas.

The system will be capable of determining whether the values retrieved by the sensors are dangerous or not, and these observations will be done for the temperature by checking if value is first above a medium threshold, in order to possibly activate the yellow led, and in the worst case above an high threshold, in order to activate the red led and the buzzer, while for gas and smoke concentration there will be a single threshold, so if the value is above that threshold the blue led will flash and the other buzzer will be activated.
I want to specify that, based on the values of temperature and concentration of gas and smoke, the system will associate a state to that feature in the environment: in particular, for temperature we have 3 states and for gas and smoke 2 states:

Temperature states:

- ALL OK! -> green led
- GROWING! -> yellow led
- WARNING! -> red led + buzzer

Gas/smoke states:

- ALL OK -> white led
- WARNING -> blue led + buzzer

## Architecture of the system

Our system is thought to be used by several devices. For this first assignment we used the STM32 Nucleo F401RE board, where all the code needed to retrieve data from sensors and to manage the actuators will be flashed. The next step is that of saving the obtained values into the cloud, in particular using Amazon Web Services. In order to do this, we need to use MQTT, that is a communication protocol based on topics: the key is that every device that is subscribed to a certain topic will receive messages published on that topic. In particular, when we will publish the data from the device, those data will be sent to an MQTT-SN Broker, in this case RSMB, and then from RSMB they will be sent to the Mosquitto broker, which is the transparent bridge between RSMB and Iot-Core, that is a service provided by AWS that uses MQTT and that we can exploit to receive data coming from our device. So, after Mosquitto redirects our data to Iot-Core, there is the needing to save them in the cloud: my choice was DynamoDB, a noSQL database provided by AWS. Once data are stored in the db, we can query them using an appropriate server in order to finally show them on the front-end side: my choice for the back-end side was NodeJS, while for the front-end side I used HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript and Vue-js. The frontend and the backend will create the Web Dashboard. Finally, the frontend will be used also to control the state of actuators. Below I show an image that higlights all the connected components of the application:

## Manual and automatic mode
The system is capable of switching between two modes through the interaction by the front-end:

- auto: data from both sensors are periodically sampled and published by MQTT towards Iot-Core, actuators are automatically controlled
- manual: the periodical sample of data is stopped in order to allow the user to manually control the actuators

This is done because there could be situations in which the manual mode could be useful, for example when sensors wrongly sample values and detect a danger, so I need to stop the auto mode in order to activate the manual mode, and then deactivate the actuators.

## Topics
Below I list the main topics used by the system:

- device/+/temperature: used to publish temperature data from a device with a certain id towards Iot-Core
- device/+/gas_smoke: used to publish gas/smoke data from a device with a certain id towards Ior-Core
- switchMode/device/+: used to publish towards a device with a certain id the indication of switching to auto/manual mode
- controlActuators/device/+: used to publish towards a device with a certain id the indication of turning on/off a certain actuator
