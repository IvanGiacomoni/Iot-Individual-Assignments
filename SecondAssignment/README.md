# Second Assignment

## Wireless Sensor Network
For the second assignment, we need to develop a **Wireless Sensor Network**: the idea is that of setupping an environment with multiple devices, where each one is able to generate the same type of data from the [previous assignment](https://github.com/IvanGiacomoni/Iot-Individual-Assignments/blob/main/FirstAssignment/README.md) and send them to the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/) cloud platform.

## Benefits and disadvantages
The main idea of a Wireless Sensor Network is that of **helping human beings** to retrieve data where it is hard for them to do this manually: so, as a consequence, there is the possibility to retrieve data from **different locations** that leads to a better **data quality**. Also, they are very easy to **install**, as well as they are very **flexible and scalable**, in the sense that they are very easy to modify and to adapt for new incoming technologies. Speaking about the **fault tolerance**, obviously if a node (device) of our network crashes or in general stops working, this could lead to a less accurate solution for the problem taken into consideration, but in general a good network is able to reduce at minimum faults in the system. The **manteinance** is related to the **energy efficiency**, so if we have a lot of devices, obviously we have less energy efficiency and manteinance will be harder. By looking at **costs**, those for installation will higher, will those for changes into the network will be lower. There are also technical limitations in terms of **throughput** and **end-to-end** delay, because these networks are made up of low-energy and low-range devices, so depending of the network conditions, throughput can increase as well as end-to-end delay can increase.

## Architecture of the system
The Wireless Sensor Network will be simulated on [Iot-lab](https://www.iot-lab.info/)

## Performance of the system
The performance of the system will be carried out with the tools provided by [Iot-lab](https://www.iot-lab.info/). In particular, we will measure and evaluate:

- the performance of the wireless sensor networ in terms of **end-to-end latency** and **throughput**
- the performance of the system as the **number of wireless elements** increases
- the **energy consumption** and **duty cycling** of the nodes
