# Third assignment
The goal of this assignment is to replace the wireless mesh network with a **long-range low-power wide area network**: in particular we will focus on the development of IoT Edge Analytics.

## Motivations
These networks are used because, at some point, we have to connect a lot of devices to the Internet and so, even we have Bluetooth or Wifi, we need some other better technologies with a **wider range** for the networking. **Endpoints costs** need to be low, and also we need to send a **small amount of data**. The **energy consumption** must be low.
In a **LPWAN**, the data rate is selected by a **tradeoff** between the **communication range** and the **duration of the message**. What is very important is the **battery life**, and also the **range**, which has to be about **2-5 km** of coverage range in **urban perimeters** and about **45 km** in **rural areas**. We also have to consider the **latency** and the **throughput** (data rates between **290 bps** and **50 kbps**).

## How is the long-range low-power wide are network going to affect the IoT platform?
For my system, given that one of the main constraints is that of having a **real time** evaluation of a possible gas leak, LoraWAN is not so useful, due to its internal latency caused by the **low data rate**. Also for the **battery life**, my system does not have problems, because Gas-Leak-and-Fire-Notifier is thought to be useful in a home environment, especially in the kitchen, and so we will always have the power supply needed for the device. A possible scenario where LoraWAN could be useful is into a house where we don't have any Wifi (and so also MQTT) or Bluetooth available, but we know that within a certain range we will find a LoraWAN gateway that could be exploited for our purposes. As explained in the introduction, we need to send a small **small amount of data** over the Internet, so an improvement that we could do with respect to the previous assignments is to send over the Internet only data related to a **warning** situation or to a **danger** situation, avoiding those related to a **good** situation.
